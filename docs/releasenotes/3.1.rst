Robotidy 3.1
=========================================

Fixes
------
- Improved stability of the Robotidy output. Now it should provide the code that does not
  change after several reruns (`#360 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/360>`_)

Other
------
- Added end to end tests to Robotidy. It should help with improving stability of the tool and catch some of the
  bugs earlier (previously transformers were tested mostly in the isolation) (`#361 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/361>`_)
