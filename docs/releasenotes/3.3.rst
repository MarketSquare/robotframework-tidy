Robotidy 3.3
=========================================

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-tidy

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-tidy==3.3

Translation updates
--------------------
With the Robot Framework 6.0 there is option to use translated markers in the Robot files.
To support this option we updated several of our transformers and added language support in the tool.

File language can be defined either by using language header::

    language: de

    *** Einstellungen ***
    Bibliothek      String

Or by using ``--language / --lang`` option::

    robotidy --language pl test.robot

English language is supported by default.

* New Translate transformer for translating Robot Framework files
* Updated NormalizeSectionHeaderName transformer to work with translated headers
* Updated MergeAndOrderSections to not merge language: <lang> header with other comment sections
* Sections with only language: <lang> marker and less than ``section_lines`` empty lines will be not transformed by NormalizeNewLines

Translate transformer
----------------------

Added new non-default transformer for translating Robot Framework files. It is possible to automatically convert your
Robot Framework files to use other supported language.

See the full documentation `here <https://robotidy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/transformers/Translate.html>`_.

Fixes
------
* Added missing ``--skip-comments`` option (#418)
* ``CONTINUE`` and ``BREAK`` statements in inline IFs are now intended correctly (#422)

Other
-----
* Reorganized our imports to better support optional rich dependency (#419)
* Replaced packaging dependency with internal version handling, which makes our installer lighter
