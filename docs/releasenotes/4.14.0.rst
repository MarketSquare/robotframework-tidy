Transformers changes
====================

Ignore comments in IndentNestedKeywords transformer (#702)
----------------------------------------------------------

``IndentNestedKeywords`` moves comments before transformation. This is required in order to properly format different
types of the source code (especially when expanding single line to multiple lines). However as side affect
``IndentNestedKeywords`` moved the comments even if the code didn't require formatting::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Keyword with commented out single line
        Run Keywords
        ...    No Operation
        # ...    No Operation
        ...    No Operation

In such case the code is already formatted and does not require moving the comments. After this release such
comments will be left alone in a case where the code is already formatted.

Use variable_separator when converting variable from camelCase in RenameVariables (#705)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously ``variable_separator`` configuration was not respected when converting variable names from camelCase to
snake_case. In result variable names were converted with spaces as the separator::

    # from
    ${camelCase}
    # to
    ${camel case}

Now the setting will be taken into account.
