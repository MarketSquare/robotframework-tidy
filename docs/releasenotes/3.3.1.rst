Fix Translate BDD keywords
---------------------------
Final release of the Robot Framework 6.0 modified the language API.
This change will breaks the Robotidy with RF 6.0 when using ``Translate`` transformer with
`translate_bdd`` set to ``True``. This release fixes it.

Do not rename variables in RenameKeyword (#417)
------------------------------------------------
Variables were also renamed in ``RenameKeyword`` transformer.
Following code::

    Login With '${user.id}'

was transformed to::

    Login With '${user.Id}'

To fix this issue we redesigned keyword name matching in the transformer.
Now it should properly escape all variables (and also possible indices).
