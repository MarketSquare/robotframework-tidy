Fixes
=====

Add Robot Framework 7.0 to target version (#620)
------------------------------------------------

``--target-version`` option did not support new Robot Framework version.

ReplaceReturns removing duplicated RETURN
------------------------------------------

In Robot Framework 7.0 ``ReplaceReturns`` removed all other instances of ``RETURN`` in the same keyword.
It is because internal model for ``RETURN`` class changed and ``ReplaceReturns`` transformer had to be updated.
