Fixes
=====

RenameKeywords capitalizes keywords with mixed spaces and underscores correctly (#537)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keywords with spaces and underscores were not capitalized correctly. First letter of each word was repeated.

Following code::

    Keyword _with_Problematic_Space_Underscore_Combination

was transformed to::

    Keyword With PPoblematic SSace UUderscore CCmbination

It should be now handled correctly.


RenameKeywords does not remove whitespace after variable (#538)
----------------------------------------------------------------

``RenameKeywords`` will now correctly replace underscore with space after variables::

    Embedded ${variable}_And_Removed_Underscores

will be transformed to::

    Embedded ${variable} And Removed Underscores
