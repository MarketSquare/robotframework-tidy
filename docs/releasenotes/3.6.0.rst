Robotidy 3.6.0
=========================================


You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-tidy

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-tidy==3.6.0

Rerun the transformation in place
----------------------------------

Because of high independence of each transformer, Robotidy runs them in specific order to obtain predictable results.
But sometimes the subsequent transformer modifies the file to the point that it requires another run of Robotidy.
Good example would be one transformer that replaces the deprecated syntax - but new syntax is inserted using standard
whitespace. If there is transformer that aligns this whitespace according to special rules (like ``AlignKeywordsSection``)
we need to run Robotidy again to format this whitespace.

This could be inconvenient in some cases where user had to rerun Robotidy without knowing why. That's why Robotidy
now has new option ``reruns`` that allows to define limit of how many extra reruns Robotidy can perform if the
file keeps changing after the transformation. The default is ``0`` (original behaviour). Recommended value is ``3``
although in vast majority of cases one extra run should suffice (and only in cases described above).

Example usage::

    robotidy --reruns 3 --diff test.robot

Note that if you enable it, it can double the execution time of Robotidy (if the file was modified, it will be
transformed again to check if next transformation does not further modify the file). It should be not a problem because
Robotidy is fast enough but report any issues with this feature.
