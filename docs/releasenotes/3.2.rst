Robotidy 3.1.0
=========================================

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-tidy

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-tidy==3.2.0

Fixed help output for different entrypoints
----------------------------------------
If the pip fails to install ``robotidy`` entry point (usually due to missing admin permissions) it needs
to be called with ``python -m robotidy``. Our help didn't print properly when calling the Robotidy in such a way.
