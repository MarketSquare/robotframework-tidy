Documentation
----------------
Several fixes and changes to our documentation (thanks to `@glueologist <https://github.com/glueologist>`__ feedback).

Our theme changed from `alabster` to `furo`. Thanks for that it will be consistent across our other tools (like Robocop),
it's a bit prettier (night mode!) and more customizable.

Fixes
----------------------------------------
* Fixed help output for different entrypoints. If the pip fails to install ``robotidy`` entry point
  (usually due to missing admin permissions) it needs to be called with ``python -m robotidy``.
  Our help didn't print properly when calling the Robotidy in such a way.

* Fixed fatal exception when running robotidy with only ``NormalizeSeparator`` enabled on FOR loop without closing END (`#390 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/390>`_).
