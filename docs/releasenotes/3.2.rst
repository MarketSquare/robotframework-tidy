Documentation
----------------

* Several fixes and changes to our documentation (thanks to `@glueologist <https://github.com/glueologist>`__ feedback).
* Our theme changed from `alabster` to `furo`. Thanks for that it will be consistent across our other tools (like Robocop),
  it's a bit prettier (night mode!) and more customizable.
* Transformer parameters and their default values are now listed transformer short docs
  (invoked via ``--desc name``) (`#377 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/377>`_).
* Transformers in the ``--list`` and ``-desc all`` command outputs are now listed in the order they are run by default

Argument indents in *** Settings ***
-------------------------------------
When ``AlignSettingsSection`` aligns multiline settings with arguments, it indents arguments:

::

    *** Settings ***
    Suite Setup         Start Session
    ...                     host=${IPADDRESS}
    ...                     user=${USERNAME}
    ...                     password=${PASSWORD}

So far it only applied to ``Suite Setup``, ``Suite Teardown``, ``Test Setup`` and ``Test Teardown`` settings.
Now it also works for ``Library`` and ``Variables`` settings (`#380 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/380>`_)::

    *** Settings ***
    Library             CustomLibrary
    ...                     first_arg    second_arg
    Library             SeleniumLibrary
    ...                     timeout=${TIMEOUT}
    ...                     implicit_wait=${TIMEOUT}
    ...                     run_on_failure=Capture Page Screenshot
    ...                 WITH NAME    Selenium

Fixes
----------------------------------------
* Fixed help output for different entrypoints. If the pip fails to install ``robotidy`` entry point
  (usually due to missing admin permissions) it needs to be called with ``python -m robotidy``.
  Our help didn't print properly when calling the Robotidy in such a way.
* Fixed fatal exception when running robotidy with only ``NormalizeSeparator`` enabled on FOR loop without closing END (`#390 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/390>`_).
* Robotidy will now properly print warning if user make a typo in ``enabled`` parameter (`#368 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/368>`_)
* Renamed invalid short name of ``--target-version`` from ``-t`` (which was duplicate of ``--transform`` short option)
  to ``--tv`` (`#375 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/375>`_.

Other
--------
* Warn if the Robotidy configuration contains duplicated names in ``--transform`` option (`#383 <https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/383>`_)
