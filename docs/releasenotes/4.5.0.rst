Fixes related to Robot Framework 6.1 changes. Additionally, the behaviour of the ``min_width`` parameter in
``AlignVariablesSection`` and ``AlignSettingsSection`` transformers changed.

Also fixed:

- ``NormalizeSeparators`` not handling Inline Ifs when ``flatten_lines`` is set to True
- Invalid variable case with extended syntax in ``RenameVariables``

You can install the latest available version by running

Fixes
=====

Robot Framework 6.1 fixes (#550)
--------------------------------

- ``Translate`` transformer should now properly handle creating Comments section (if needed),
- Missing settings translations should now be ignored by ``Translate`` transformer,
- Files with invalid sections (for example unrecognized translated section names) should be ignored by
  ``MergeAndOrderSections``

``NormalizeSeparators`` with ``flatten_lines=True`` not handling Inline IFs (#548)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robotidy should now correctly handles Inline IFs in ``NormalizeSeparators`` transformer with ``flatten_lines=True``.
Previously, spacing before `ELSE` and `ELSE IF` branches was set to 0::

    IF    ${value}>0    Do Thing    ELSE    Do Other Thing

it was transformed to::

    IF    ${value}>0    Do ThingELSE    Do Other Thing

Additionally, number of spaces before `ELSE` and `ELSE IF` in Inline IFs should now be calculated correctly
(based on the separator length and not indentation).

Invalid variable case with extended syntax in RenameVariables (#551)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Robotidy should now be able to recognize variables using extended variable syntax and set variable case accordingly::

    *** Test Cases ***
    Simple math operations
        ${i}    Set Variable    ${0}
        Log    ${i+1}  # i+1 instead of previous I+1

Minimal width of the column in AlignVariablesSection and AlignSettingsSection (#558)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``AlignVariablesSection`` and ``AlignSettingsSection`` transformers use ``min_width`` parameter.
Contrary to the name, it didn't set minimal width of the column, but set fixed width of the column.
To clear this confusion and to fill missing feature we have:

- introduced new parameter ``fixed_width`` which work the same as previous ``min_width``
- ``min_width`` is now fixed and is used to configure minimal width of the aligned column

If you are relying on ``min_width`` to set fixed width of the column, rename it to ``fixed_width`` in your
configuration.
