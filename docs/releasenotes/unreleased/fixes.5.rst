Typos in the documentation (#656, #588)
---------------------------------------

Several typos were fixed in our documentation. Feel free to report any issue - to improve documentation for everyone!

We have also reorganized some of the information in the documentation to make it easier to find information. For
example disablers are now in the separate page instead of quickstart page.
