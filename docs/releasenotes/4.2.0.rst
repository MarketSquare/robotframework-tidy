Robotidy 4.2.0
================

Completely refactored our configuration file handling to allow multiple configuration files.

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-tidy

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-tidy==4.2.0

Multiple configuration files support (#506)
-------------------------------------------

Configuration file could be either loaded using cli (with ``--config`` option) or auto-detected in the current project.
The auto-detected configuration file was always first configuration found in the parent directories common
for all sources. Now it will be possible to create multiple configuration files in the project.

With following file structure::

    root/
      pyproject.toml
      source/
        test.robot
        nested/
            pyproject.toml
            test2.robot

The ``test.robot`` file will use ``root/pyproject.toml`` configuration file and ``test2.robot`` will use
``root/source/nested/pyproject.toml``.

Flatten multiline statements with NormalizeSeparators
-------------------------------------------------------

New ``flatten_lines`` option in ``NormalizeSeparators`` transformer. By default ``NormalizeSeparators`` only updates
the separators and leave any multiline intact. Now it is possible to flatten multiline statements into single line
using ``flatten_lines``::

    > robotidy -c NormalizeSeparators:flatten_lines=True src
