Robotidy 3.5.0
=========================================


You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-tidy

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-tidy==3.5.0
Misc
-----

- ``OrderSettingsSection`` now allows to order using ``Test Tags``. It worked before but custom order configuration
  only accepted "force_tags" but now it also accepts "test_tags" alias

Bugs
-----

- ``Force Tags`` will not be replaced with ``Test Tags`` by ``OrderTags`` transformer (#469)
