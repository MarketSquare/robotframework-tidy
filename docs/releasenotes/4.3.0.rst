Fixes
=====

ReplaceReturns and ReplaceBreakContinue now handle multiline statements correctly (#529)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiline statements were not correctly handled by ``ReplaceReturns``and ``ReplaceBreakContinue`` transformers.
To fix this issue we are now flattening the multiline statements first before replacing the syntax
(formatting is no longer preserved). Additionally, the comments inside transformed syntax are now preserved.
