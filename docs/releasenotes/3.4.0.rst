``SplitTooLongLine`` changes
------------------------------

Too long lines in run keywords (#451)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SplitTooLongLine`` will not split too long line in run keywords (such as ``Run Keyword If`` or
``Wait Until Keyword Succeeds``) if ``IndentNestedKeywords`` is enabled. The too long lines will be split by
``IndentNestedKeywords`` instead.

Following code::

    *** Keywords ***
    Run keyword with too long lines
        Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    30 sec    1 sec    Run Keywords    Reload Page    AND    Element Should Contain    ${myVeryLongDefinitionOfAnElement}    ${addingTheSecondArgumentMakesThisLineTooLong}

When both ``SplitTooLongLine`` and ``IndentNestedKeywords`` were enabled was transformed to::

    *** Keywords ***
    Run keyword with too long lines
        Wait Until Keyword Succeeds
        ...    30 sec
        ...    1 sec
        ...    Run Keywords
        ...    Reload Page
        ...    AND
        ...    Element Should Contain
        ...    ${myVeryLongDefinitionOfAnElement}
        ...    ${addingTheSecondArgumentMakesThisLineTooLong}

Before, the formatting from the ``IndentNestedKeywords`` was overwritten by the ``SplitTooLongLine`` formatting.
Now indents in run keywords are preserved and too long lines are split properly::

    *** Keywords ***
    Run keyword with too long lines
        Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    30 sec    1 sec
        ...    Run Keywords
        ...        Reload Page
        ...        AND
        ...        Element Should Contain    ${myVeryLongDefinitionOfAnElement}
        ...            ${addingTheSecondArgumentMakesThisLineTooLong}
