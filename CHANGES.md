# Change Log

## Unreleased

### Disable formatting from source code

Previously the only option to disable formatting in part of the file was to use cumbersome 
``--startline`` and ``--endline`` markers. This release brings new feature - comment disablers. 
You can disable formatting in Robot Framework statement or in span of lines using ``# robocop: off`` marker.

To skip the formatting for one statement:

```robotframework
Keyword That Is Longer Than Allowed Line Length  ${arg}  # robotidy: off
```

To skip multiple lines:

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Test that will be formatted
    Step

# robotidy: off
Test that will not be formatted
    Step

# robotidy: on
Another test that will be formatted
    Step
```

``# robotidy: on`` marker is used to enable the formatting again - but is not required. ``# robotidy: off`` will disable 
the formatting to the end of the current block:

```robotframework
Keyword That Is Formatted
IF    $condition
    Formatted
ELSE
    Formatted
    # robotidy: off
    Not Formatted
    WHILE    $condition
        Not Formatted
    END
END
Formatted
```

It's possible to disable the formatting in whole file by putting ``# robotidy: off`` on first line:

```robotframework
# robotidy: off
*** Settings ***
Library    Collections
```

You can also disable the formatting in whole section if you put ``# robotidy: off`` in section header:

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Formatted
    Step

*** Keywords ***  # robotidy: off
Not Formatted
    Step
```

### Fixes
- It's no longer possible to forcefully enable transformer not supported in installed Robot Framework version ([#281](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/281), [#283](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/283))

### Other
- You can now disable coloring the output with ``--no-color`` cli option or by setting ``$NO_COLOR`` environment variable ([#268](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/268))

## 2.1.1

### Fixes
- ``*** Tasks ***`` will no longer be renamed to ``*** Test Cases ***`` by NormalizeSectionHeaderName ([#279](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-robocop/issues/279)).

## 2.1

### Transformers
- Updated `NormalizeNewLines` to separate sections by two empty lines (instead of one). It's effort of normalizing 
  Robocop output (which suggest to use 2 empty lines) and Robotidy (which previously transformed with 1 empty line) ([#536](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-robocop/issues/536)).

  Previously:
  ```
  *** Settings ***
  Force Tags    tag
  
  *** Test Cases ***
  Test
      No Operation
  ```
  
  Now:
  ```
  *** Settings ***
  Force Tags    tag
  
  
  *** Test Cases ***
  Test
      No Operation
  ```

### Other
- Add missing packaging dependency ([#275](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/275))

## 2.0.0

### Transformers
- New `ReplaceReturns` transformer that replaces return statements (such as `[Return]` setting or `Return From Keyword` keyword) with `RETURN` statement ([#231](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/231))
- New `ReplaceBreakContinue` transformer that replaces `Continue For Loop` and `Exit For Loop` keyword variants with CONTINUE and BREAK statements ([#241](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/241))
- New `InlineIf` transformer that replaces IF blocks with inline IF ([#230](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/230))
- Add `min_width` parameter to `AlignSettingsSection` transformer. It allows to set minimal width of data column ([#242](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/242))
- Add `min_width` parameter to `AlignVariablesSection` transformer. It allows to set minimal width of data column ([#242](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/242))
- Add `min_width` parameter to `AlignTestCases` transformer. It allows to set minimal width of data column ([#242](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/242))
- Changed behaviour of `DiscardEmptySections` transformer. Now by default section with only comments are not considered empty. 
  Configure `allow_only_comments` to `False` if you want to remove those sections ([#235](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/235))
- Add `skip_types` parameter to `AlignVariablesSection` which allows to not align variables of particular type ([#225](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/225))
- Library names are now ignored by default by `RenameKeywords` transformer. Previously, it could result in an unexpected behaviour ([#269](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/269)).
  If you want to transform library names, pass `ignore_library=False` to the transformer.

### Other
- Change exceptions to be more user-friendly. Robotidy will try to recognize common mistakes. For unknown issues there is extra message with link to our bug board ([#250](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/250))
- Refactored Robotidy acceptance tests ([#248](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/248))
- It is now possible to force overwrite with ``--check`` and ``--overwrite`` flags ([#239](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/239)).
  Going over possible options:

  Transform the files and return 0 even if there were files transformed.
  ```commandline
  robotidy src
  ```
  
  Don't transform the files and return 0 even if there would be files transformed
  ```commandline
  robotidy --no-overwrite src
  ```
  
  Don't transform the files and return 1 if there would be files transformed
  ```commandline
  robotidy --check src
  ```
  
  Transform the files and return 1 if there are files transformed
  ```commandline
  robotidy --check --overwrite src
  ```

### Fixes
- Unmodified files are now not saved to the disk ([#237](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/237))

## 1.6.2

### Fixes
- `AddMissingEnd` transformer now properly handles IFs without indented block of code ([#226](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/226))
- Paths passed from command line are now checked against excluded paths (previously it was only checked when iterating over directories) ([#227](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/227))

## 1.6.1

### Fixes
- Trailing whitespace is no longer added to blank lines in multiline statements when using align transformers ([#219](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/219))
- `*** Tasks ***` is no longer converted to `*** Test Cases ***` by NormalizeSectionHeaderName ([#218](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/218))

## 1.6.0

### Transformers
- New non default transformer `RenameTestCases`. It capitalizes first letter of the test case name, removes trailing dot and can replace provided regex pattern with substitute string ([#183](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/183))
- New non default transformer `RenameKeywords`. It applies Title Case to keyword name and replace underscores by spaces and can replace provided regex pattern with substitute string ([#183](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/183))
- Added `AlignTestCases` transformer for aligning templated test cases in column. Because it's in experimental mode it will be non default for now (see docs for information how to run it) ([#185](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/185))
- Missing ENDs in for loop and if statements will be added by new `AddMissingEnd` transformer ([#91](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/91))
- `NormalizeAssignments` now recognizes assignments from ``*** Variables ***`` section separately. It allows you to configure different assignment sign type for keyword calls and for variables section ([#159](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/159))

  With this change following command will change all assignments signs to `=` for keyword calls and remove them in ``*** Variables ***`` sections.
  ```
  robotidy -c NormalizeAssignments:equal_sign_type=equal_sign -c NormalizeAssignments:equal_sign_type_variables=remove <src>
  ```
- New `OrderTags` (non default) transformer. It orders tags in lexicographic order ([#205](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/205))
- New `NormalizeTags` (non default) transformer. It normalizes tag name case and removes duplicates ([#212](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/212))

### Features
- It is now possible to provide source paths in configuration file ([#154](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/154))
- Non default transformers can be enabled using ``enabled=True`` parameter ([#182](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/182))
- Semicolon in parameter value can now be escaped with `\:` ([#190](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/190))
- Default separator can be changed from space to tabular with new ``--separator`` option ([#184](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/184))
- ``--lineseparator`` option now accepts `auto` value for preserving line endings found in the file ([#209](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/209))

### Fixes
- Robotidy will not print "Loaded configuration from ... " if the configuration is empty ([#193](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/193))
- no source path provided error now exits with code 1 instead of 0 ([#208](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/208))

### Other
- ReplaceRunKeywordIf now removes ELSE branch if it is unnecessary ([#192](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/192))

- New AlignSettingsSection for aligning ``*** Settings ***`` section into columns [#60](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/60)
- New NormalizeSeparators for normalizing all separators and indents to fixed length (according to global ``--spacecount`` option) [#32](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/32)
- New RemoveEmptySettings transformer for removing empty settings such like `Suite Setup` or `[Arguments]`. Settings that are overwriting suite settings (like empty `[Tags]` overwriting `Default Tags`) are preserved. See the docs for config options [#78](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/78)

### Features
- New option ``--configure`` or ``-c`` for configuring transformer parameters. It works the same way configuring through ``--transform`` works. The benefit of using ``--configure`` is that you can configure selected transformers and still run all transformers [#96](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/96)
- Transformers can now be disabled by default if you add ``ENABLED = False`` class attribute to your class. Those transformers will be only run when selected explicitly with ``--transform`` option [#10](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/10)
- Support for ``pyproject.toml`` configuration files. Because of the required changes there are backward incompatible changes done to ``robotidy.toml`` syntax. See example from [README](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/blob/main/README.rst#configuration-file) [#66](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/66)
- ``--list-transformers`` output is now ordered. Also transformers themselves will always run in the same predefined order [#69](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/69)
- ``--describe-transformer`` output is now pre-formatted (removed rst formatting) [#83](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/83)
- Several options have now abbreviations: [#92](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/92)
  - ``--transform`` can be also used with ``-t``
  - ``--list-transformers`` can be also used with ``--list`` or ``-l``
  - ``--describe-transformer`` can be also used with ``--desc`` or ``-d`` 

### Fixes
- SplitTooLongLine will now parse multiple assignment values correctly [#68](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/68)
- AlignSettingsSection is now parsing empty lines in multi lines correctly (those lines are removed) [#75](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/75)
- Fix ``--diff`` option not displaying colours on Windows [#86](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/86)
- Fix issue where variable was not left aligned if name was prefixed with space (`` {variable} 4``) [#88](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/88)

### Other
- Support for pipes is now removed. All pipes will be converted to spaces by NormalizeSeparators transformer. It can be restored if people that use pipe syntax request for it
- Files with invalid encoding will now not stop robotidy execution - warning will be printed instead

## 1.1.1

### Fixes

- AlignVariablesSection should ignore lines with only comments

## 1.1.0

### Transformers

- Added alignVariablesSection for aligning variables and their values in column like appearance [#50](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-tidy/issues/50)

### Fixes

- selectable transformers (chose how you want to transform your code)
- robotidy configuration can be supplied from cli and config file (which can be pointed to or autodetected in directory if the name is 'robotidy.toml'
- option ``--no-overview`` to disable writing to files
- option ``--diff`` to display file diff with the changes done by robotidy
- option ``--check`` to return status depending on if any file was modified by robotidy
- options ``--spacecount`` and ``--lineseparator`` for defining global formatting rules
